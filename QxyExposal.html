    <h1>Qxy Exposal</h1>

    <h2>Who is Qxy?</h2>
    <p>Hello, I have come here today to talk about a predator called Qxy. Qxy is currently staff in the SonicElijahMania Discord server.</p>
    
    <h2>What did Qxy do?</h2>
    <p>Qxy had been messaging a minor, someone under 15, and emotionally manipulated them into feeling bad about breaking up, making the minor worry that she might harm herself if they ended the relationship.</p>

    <h2>Resources for Support and Reporting</h2>
    <p>If this happens to anyone you know:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Report to Discord: Use the in-app report feature for server staff violations.</li>
        <li>Hotlines: Contact organizations like the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) at <a href="https://www.cybertipline.org" target="_blank">cybertipline.org</a> for online exploitation reports.</li>
        <li>Mental health support: Resources like the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (988 in the US) for anyone affected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Analysis of Qxy's Manipulation</h2>
    <p>This was created quickly, but it is important for people to understand. You cannot try Qxy yourself; she is a highly skilled manipulator. Here's proof:</p>

    <pre>
I DM'd Qxy the message: "I hope you get help" and she responded with:
"Don't worry, I understand why he broke up. I take responsibility for the actions done in that doc, just don't wanna start any drama. I've already seeked some help from other people and yeah."

This message contains several manipulation techniques:

1. "Don't worry, I understand why he broke up."
   - Frames me as the one who needs to calm down.
   - Implies she is reasonable and in control, making any negative judgment mine, not hers.

2. "I take responsibility for the actions done in that doc."
   - Sounds accountable at first.
   - Limits responsibility to the document, avoiding full emotional fallout.
   - Partial accountability: looks like admission but keeps her protected.

3. "Just don't wanna start any drama."
   - Guilt-shaping: frames me as the drama-starter.
   - Makes her appear mature, rational, and calm while warning me to avoid trouble.

4. "I've already seeked some help from other people and yeah."
   - Self-exoneration: signals responsibility by seeking help.
   - Subtly pressures for forgiveness or to stop worrying.
   - Acts as an emotional shield; any concern from me could feel invalid.
