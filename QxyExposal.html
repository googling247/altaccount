    <h1>PLEASE READ THIS</h1>
    <p>This was thrown together very quickly as it is very important people know. You cannot try Qxy, Qxy is a very very impressive manipulator. Here's proof:\nI dmed Qxy the message: "I hope you get help" and she responded with:\nDont worry, I understand why he broke up. I take responsibility for the actions done in that doc, just dont wanna start any drama. I've already seeked some help from other people and yeah.\nThis message has alot of manipulation techiniques in it. Here they are:\nDont worry, I understand why he broke up. First sentence: This frames ME as the one who needs to calm down. It implies she’s already reasonable and in control, so any negative judgment would make me the problem, not her. I take responsibility for the actions done in that doc\nSecond part: At first, it sounds accountable, but I realised her saying actions done in that doc that her being limited and avoiding responsibility for the emotional fallout or consequences, only what’s in the document. She did only partial accountability. It looks like she was admitting, but shes making it sound only like a little so she doesn't expose herself completely.\n , just dont wanna start any drama.\nThird part: This is guilt-shaping, framing me as the drama-starter. It makes her sound mature, rational, calm, while warning me to not cause trouble.\nI've already seeked some help from other people and yeah.\nLast part: This is self-exoneration, she's saying that she's responsible by seeking help, also subtly saying that she's "improving" so I should forgive her or stop worrying. Also it's a emotional shield, any concern from me could've felt invalid, if i didn't know these techinques</p>
